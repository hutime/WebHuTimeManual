    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>HuTime provides Web pages (or Web applications) with functionality of showing a variety of information, including text, numbers, and images, along linear data, such as time. This page provides an introduction to basic operations that should be known by users of Web pages or Web applications using HuTime. For information for developers, including how to customize the view or functions, see the documents under &quot;API Overview&quot; in the <a
            href="index.html">Contents</a> page.</p>

    <h3>Components and Names</h3>
    <div class="contentFigure"><img src="/manual/img/PartsName.gif" alt="HuTime snapshot"/></div>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight:700;">Panel</span>: A fundamental component for displaying data. You can change the display position and height (width in vertical display mode) of each panel.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight:700;">Panel collection</span>: A group of one or more panels for display. When multiple panels are displayed, they are overlapped.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="section02">
    <h2>2. Horizontal Display Mode and Vertical Display Mode</h2>
    <p>The display mode of reference data (e.g., time) along which a variety of information, such as data, is displayed can be either lateral (horizontal display mode) or perpendicular (vertical display mode) to the screen. In horizontal display mode, the reference data can go from left to right or from right to left. Similarly, in vertical display mode, it can go from top to bottom or from bottom to top.</p>

    <h2>3. Changing and Zooming In/Out a Displayed Range</h2>
    <h3>Changing a Displayed Range</h3>
    <p>You can change the displayed range through dragging the screen. In horizontal display mode, drag the screen in the lateral direction, whereas in vertical display mode, drag it in the perpendicular direction. While you are dragging the screen, the new range that is to be displayed is omitted and not shown. However, when you finish dragging it (release the mouse button) or when you stop dragging it (stop moving the mouse while pressing the mouse button), the omitted portion of the screen is drawn.</p>

    <h3>Zooming In or Zooming Out the Displayed Range</h3>
    <p>You can zoom in or zoom out the displayed range by using the wheel on the mouse. The displayed range is zoomed in or out around the point where the mouse cursor is located. During this operation, the new range and its contents that are to be displayed are omitted and not shown. However, when you stop the operation, the whole range is redrawn. If the number of digits for the displayed range exceeds the prescribed significant digit when you zoom in or out the screen, you cannot zoom in or out it any further.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="section04">
    <h2>4. Adjusting the Display Position of a Panel</h2>
    <h3>Scrolling the Panel</h3>
    <p>If you cannot see all panels, or if you can see only part of a panel, you can drag a panel (up and down in horizontal display mode, or from side to side in vertical display mode) to scroll the entire panel collection.</p>

    <h3>Changing the Panel Height</h3>
    <p>If you want to change the height of a panel (the width in vertical display mode), you can do it by dragging the bottom edge of the panel (the rightmost edge in vertical display mode). When you move the mouse cursor to the point where the height of the panel can be changed, the shape of the cursor changes, letting you know that the height is now changeable.</p>

    <h3>Replacing Panels</h3>
    <p>You can change the order of overlapped panels by using mouse and keyboard operation. Dragging a panel while pressing the Shift key makes the panel translucent, and now you can move it freely. When you drop the panel on top of a destination panel, the panel is inserted to the position.</p>
